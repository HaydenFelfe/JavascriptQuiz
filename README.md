This project is creating a mulitple choise answer quiz with five different quesitons about javascript. To start the quiz, there is a button called "Start Quiz" once you load the application. This directs you to a series of questions, and once you answer the question correctly it allows you to go to the next question. This is a timed quiz and must be completed in 75 seconds, and if you get a question wrong it will deduct 10 seconds from your total time. Your final score is calculated based off how many seconds you have left on the time when you submit your answer to the fifth question. Once finished, you are able to record your score to the local server by entering your initials. If you want to compare your score to everyone else who has taken the quiz then you can click the button "View Highscores" which will then show all the high scores ranked from the highest to lowest.
